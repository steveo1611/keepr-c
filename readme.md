## Keepr

Keepr is a social network that allows users to visually share, and discover new interests by posting (known as 'keeping' on Keepr) images or videos to their own or others' collections (i.e. a collection of 'vaults,' usually with a common theme) and browsing what other users have kept. 


Known issues: (will fix soon)
-vault delete function not implimented yet.
-need to setup modals to close with button
-currently able to select same 'keep' multiple times for same vault.
- share functionality not setup yet.
- UI still needs a lot of clean up and fixes.
